# 4D-PIONIX

This repository contains the code used for 4D-PIONIX (4D physics-informed optimized neural implicit X-ray imaging). For more detailed information about ONIX training and performance, please refer to our paper [Physics-informed 4D X-ray image reconstruction from ultra-sparse spatiotemporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03469).
